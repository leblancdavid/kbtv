## INCOME SOURCES

### Tier 1: Core Income (Implement First)

| Source | Description | Mechanics |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Ads** | Per-listener revenue during breaks | ✅ Already implemented |
| **Sponsorships** | Fixed recurring payments from sponsors | Weekly/nightly payment, unlock tiers based on listener count. Relationship meter - miss obligations and they leave. |
| **Affiliates** | Other stations syndicate your show | Passive income based on listener milestones. Each affiliate = X% bonus income per show. |

### Tier 2: Secondary Income (Mid-Game)

| Source | Description | Mechanics |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Merchandise** | T-shirts, bumper stickers, "I Believe" gear | Unlock at credibility/listener milestones. One-time investment to launch. Generates passive income per show. |
| **Donations** | Listener pledges during pledge drives | Special segment type. Revenue based on listener loyalty/belief meter. |
| **Premium Hotline** | Paid caller line ($X/min) | Higher revenue callers but riskier (less screening). |

### Tier 3: Late-Game Income

| Source | Description | Mechanics |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Publications** | Book deals, magazine articles | Unlock at high credibility. Major one-time payments + ongoing royalties. |
| **Web/Blog/Podcast** | Online presence | Passive income stream. Requires initial investment. |
| **Syndication Deals** | National/international broadcast | End-game goal. Massive income but high expectations. |

## THE DELAY/DUMP BUTTON

### Mechanic Overview

When callers curse on air, player must hit the DUMP button in time to bleep it.

### How It Works

1. Caller audio plays curse (player hears it)
2. **DUMP button** flashes RED in header bar
3. Player has ~1-2 seconds to hit the button
4. **If hit in time**: Curse is bleeped, no fine, small listener dip
5. **If missed**: Curse airs, FCC fine, larger listener impact

### Delay Equipment Upgrade

| Level | Name | Cost | Window |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| 0 | None | — | 0s (no protection) |
| 1 | Basic Delay | $400 | 1.0s |
| 2 | Standard Delay | $900 | 1.5s |
| 3 | Professional Delay | $1,800 | 2.0s |
| 4 | Broadcast Delay Pro | $3,500 | 2.5s + pre-flash hint |

### Curse Probability Factors

- Caller mood (angry = higher chance)
- Caller type (drunk, ranter = higher)
- Topic heat (controversial = higher)
- Base chance: ~5% per caller

## MAINTENANCE SYSTEM

### Equipment Degradation

Equipment has a **condition meter** (100% → 0%) that decays each show.

| Level | Decay/Show | Maintenance Cost | Maintain Every |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------------|
| L1 | 3% | $20 | ~10 shows |
| L2 | 4% | $35 | ~8 shows |
| L3 | 5% | $50 | ~7 shows |
| L4 | 6% | $75 | ~6 shows |

### Condition Thresholds

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 100-70% | Full performance |
| 70-40% | Degraded (audio quality penalty) |
| 40-20% | Warning (10% failure chance/show) |
| 20-1% | Critical (30% failure chance/show) |
| 0% | Broken (must replace at full cost) |

### Maintenance Strategy

- **Optimal**: Maintain when condition drops to ~70%
- **Cost if maintained**: ~$30-60/show average
- **Cost if neglected**: $300-3000 replacement

## STAFF SYSTEM

### Staff Pool (Fixed, Unlocks Over Time)

| Position | Unlock | Salary/Show | Behavior |

| Intern | Show 15 | $15 | Passive (minor bonuses, occasional mistakes) |
| Assistant Screener | Show 25 | $40 | Autonomous (pre-screens queue) |
| Tech | Show 35 | $50 | Passive (reduces equipment decay) |
| Security | Show 40 | $35 | Passive (reduces external events) |
| Producer | Show 50 | $60 | Autonomous (manages ad breaks) |
